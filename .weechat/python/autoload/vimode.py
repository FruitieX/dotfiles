# Description:
# An attempt to add a vi-like mode to WeeChat, which provides some common vi
# key bindings and commands, as well as normal/insert modes.
#
# Usage:
# To switch to Normal mode, press Ctrl + Space. The Escape key can be used as
# well, though it's still a bit flaky (it's also been reported it's even more
# flaky on older versions, so update your WeeChat to 0.4.2+).
#
# To switch back to Insert mode, you can use i/a/A (or cw/ce/...).
# To execute a command, simply precede it with a ':' while in normal mode,
# for example: ":h" or ":s/foo/bar".
#
# Current key bindings:
# j                                      Scroll buffer up * (scrolls a few lines at a time)
# k                                      Scroll buffer down * (same as above)
# w                                      Forward to the beginning of word
# e                                      Forward to the end of word
# b                                      Backward to the beginning of word
# gg                             Go to top of buffer * (no counts)
# G                                      Go to bottom of buffer
# h                                      Move cursor left
# l                                      Move cursor right
# 0                                      Go to beginning of line
# ^                                      Go to beginning of line * (doesn't take whitespace into
#                                        consideration, behaves like '0')
# $                                      Go to end of line * (same as above)
# x                                      Delete character at cursor
# dw                             Delete word
# db                             Delete previous word
# de                             Delete till end of word
# d^                             Delete till beginning of line
# d$                             Delete till end of line
# dd                             Delete line
# ce                             Delete till end of word, switch to insert mode
# cw                             Delete word, switch to insert mode
# cb                             Delete previous word, switch to insert mode
# c^                             Delete till beginning of line, switch to insert mode
# c$                             Delete till end of line, switch to insert mode
# dd                             Delete line, switch to insert mode
# /                                      Launch WeeChat search mode
# Counts (e.g. 'd2w', '2G') are supported. However, key bindings marked with a
# '*' won't perform as intended for the time being. Explanation follows in
# parentheses.
# TODO: yy yw ye yb p, make 'e'/'w'/... return start/end positions to avoid
#               redundancy and make them usable by multiple modifiers (e.g. 'de', 'dw')

# :w                             Saves settings (/save)
# :s/pattern/repl

#                                        re module for more information). '&' in the replacement is
#                                        also substituted by the pattern. If the 'g' flag isn't
#                                        present, only the first match will be substituted.
#                                        Escapes are not interpreted for repl (e.g. '\&'), and '/'
#                                        isn't expected to be used/escaped anywhere in the command.
#                                        TODO: Improve this.
# TODO: :! (probably using shell.py)
#               :w <file> saves buffer's contents to file
#               :r <file> puts file's content in input line/open in buffer?
# TODO: Display matching commands with (basic) help, like Penta/Vimp do.
#
# History:
#         version 0.1: initial release
#         version 0.2: added esc to switch to normal mode, various key bindings and
#                                  commands.
#         version 0.2.1: fixes/refactoring
